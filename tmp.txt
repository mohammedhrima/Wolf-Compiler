Dear Mr. Jaidi,

I’m eager to apply for the Frontend Developer Intern role at your company. With hands-on experience in Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I’ve built projects like:

UraJS: A lightweight frontend framework (Next.js-inspired) with file-based routing and automated Docker/Nginx deployment.

DeepSeek AI Clone: A responsive chatbot using Next.js, Tailwind, and MongoDB for real-time interactions.

I also have backend exposure (Docker, PostgreSQL, Nginx), which helps me collaborate effectively across the stack. I’d welcome the chance to contribute to your team’s projects while growing my skills.

Attached is my CV for your review. Thank you for your time—I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
