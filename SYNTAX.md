- function declaration
- function call
- function return
- function with arguementa
- if, else, elif
- while loop
- continue 
- break
- Implement built-in functions
- references
- reference as function parameter
- assign variable from refrence
- assign reference from variable
- refrence variables
- maybe I will need to declare arguments as variables inside function declaration

+ check all conditions to be boolean
+ for loops
+ use return with refrence
+ math operations with refrence
+ check function existance in generate_ir
+ import files in tokenize

+ data types: int, char, float, bigInt, bigFloat
+ arrays
+ structs: attributes, memeber function, operator overloading
+ logic operator for all data types
+ math operator for all data types
+ assign struct with value, and with refrence

+ try, catch
+ switch, case
+ input, output, filesystem

+ check functions compatibilty
+ test with c libraries
+ test function with lot of arguments
+ test all possible cases that can be handled, so the code does not crash

+ implement output
+ (To be checked if neccessary) set registers for function argument , in generate_ir
+ every loop inside source code should check found_error
+ void function need to be checked
+ global variable
+ when you finish the code check this approach, setting ptr at the end before generatin assembly code
+ to handle segvaults, try implement an approach that fork() then execute the program inside child process and read from its stderr
+ check all dat type are together in all places
+ try using memset/memcpy to assign struct, it would be better
